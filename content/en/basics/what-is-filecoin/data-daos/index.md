description: "Learn Data DAO key concepts and how to get started with Data DAOs."
lead: "The Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) enables the creation and management of specialized decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) called _Data DAOs_ that collect, curate, organize, manage and monetize useful data in a decentralized manner. Because stake in Data DAOs can be tokenized, the value and utility of data can be objectively expressed and transacted within markets in exchange for services to be performed on the data. This page provides an overview of key concepts and how Filecoin users can get started with Data DAOs."

{{< details "Before reading this page, ensure that you are familiar with the following concepts:" >}}

- **Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)**: Distributed entities whose ownership, governance, and decision-making processes are transparently conducted via on-chain activities, and are tasked with a collective mission.

- **Smart contracts**: Self-executing programs that operate on the Filecoin Virtual Machine and are used to automate the enforcement and execution of agreements between network participants. Smart contracts on the Filecoin network can be used to manage storage and retrieval deals, allocate storage resources, and facilitate the governance of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and other decentralized applications (dApps).

## Use cases and problems solved

## Example

Imagine a data DAO with a mission to augment the value, worth, and utility of existing raw data sets. In such a DAO, members could harvest tokens by performing useful analysis, computations and modeling on existing datasets, and the DAO could in turn sell the augmented data to interested parties. Stakeholders could then spend tokens to incentivize even production of even more raw data, resulting in a circular, data-centric economy.

## Designing a Data DAO

There is no canonical Data DAO solution. However, when designing and developing a data DAO, users should consider the following:

- Authentication 
- Data aggregation methods
- Data replication
- Data repair
- Encryption
- Funding
- Governance mechanics
- Market 
- Storage longevity
- Storage provider reputation, geography, etc.
- Tokenization
