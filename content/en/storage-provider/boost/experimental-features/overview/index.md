Filecoin Boost is developing new market features on a regular basis as part of the overall market development. This section covers the experimental features released by boost along with details on how to use them.

It is **not** recommended to run experimental features in production environments. The features should be tested as per your requirements, and any issues or requests should be reported to the team via Github or Slack.

Once the new features have been tested and vetted, they will be released as part of a stable Boost release and all documentation concerning those features will be moved to an appropriate section of this site.

Current experimental features are listed below.
